<h1><i>31 wellness tips for healthy & happy living</i></h1>
<br/>
<h6><b>Here are 31 tips to live a healthier, happier lifestyle... all simple, easy things that can be 

seamlessly incorporated into your daily life:<b/></h6>
<br/><br/>

<h3>1. drink a glass of water first thing in the morning</h3>
<br/>
<h5>Coffee is great too, but it is best to start your day by rehydrating with a full glass of water. 

Hydrating first thing in the morning helps to aid digestion, enhance skin health and boost 

energy.</h5>
<br/><br/>

<h3>2. take the stairs</h3>
<br/>
<h5>Taking the stairs instead of the elevator is a simple way to get a little more physical activity 

in your daily life. It also strengthens and tones your legs and core while you are at it.</h5>
<br/><br/>

<h3>3. make half your plate veggies</h3>
<br/>
<h5>A simple hack for healthy eating is to make half your plate veggies at each meal. The veggies pack 

in essential vitamins, minerals and other phytonutrients important for health and longevity. And, 

because they are rich in fiber, they help to aid digestion and keep you feeling full longer.</h5>
<br/><br/>

<h3>4. get a fitness tracker + track your steps</h3>
<br/>
<h5>Using a fitness tracker to track your steps is an easy way to make sure you are getting enough 

physical activity each day. We aim for 10,000 steps daily, which has significant physical and mental 

health benefits. A fitness tracker will also remind you to get 250 steps each hour.</h5>
<br/><br/>

<h3>5. switch to non-toxic household cleaning products</h3>
<br/>
<h5>Conventional household cleaning products are full of harmful chemical ingredients that are not 

good for our health. Switching to healthier alternatives is a simple way to reduce your exposure to 

environmental toxins in your home. </h5>
<br/><br/>

<h3>6. use non-toxic skincare + personal care products</h3>
<br/>
<h5>Similar to cleaning products, conventional skincare and personal care products are formulated with 

toxic ingredients we should not regularly let absorb into our body s largest organ. Reduce the toxic 

burden on your body by switching to non toxic personal care and beauty products.</h5>
<br/><br/>

<h3>7. take a probiotic daily</h3>
<br/>
<h5>Maintaining a healthy gut has significant impacts on digestion, skin health, immunity, mental 

health and more. Taking a daily probiotic with a glass of water each morning is one of the simplest 

things you can do to boost your gut health (which, in turn, boosts overall health in many ways 

too).</h5>
<br/><br/>

<h3>8. eat real food</h3>
<br/>
<h5>Aim to eat real food that is made of whole food ingredients you would have in your own kitchen 

pantry, or that your grandmother would recognize. (Yup, this rules out most packaged food, sorry!) 

This is a little different than suggesting you eat only health foods (many of which are increasingly 

processed!). Real food includes unprocessed foods like an apple, a cucumber, soybeans or a steak, as 

well as foods loosely processed from one (or few) real food ingredients, like butter, olive oil, 

yogurt, tofu, etc. In other words, aim for foods that could be reasonably made in your own kitchen and 

avoid foods that can only be made in a lab.</h5>
<br/><br/>

<h3>9. stand up every 30 minutes while working</h3>
<br/>
<h5>Reduce the harmful effects of sitting (like at your desk job) by standing up and moving around for 

a minute or two every half hour. </h5>
<br/><br/>

<h3>10. get sunlight every day</h3>
<br/>
<h5>Vitamin D is one of the most important nutrients for overall health, and sunlight is one of our 

best sources of it. Aim to get at least 30 minutes of sunlight each day... preferably in the afternoon, 

and without sunscreen (read more about that here). Not much sunlight in the winter where you live? It 

might be worth supplementing with a vitamin D supplement and/or other food sources of this essential 

nutrient.</h5>
<br/><br/>

<h3>11. fill your home with houseplants</h3>
<br/>
<h5>Houseplants help to cleanse your indoor air (sadly, it probably needs it!), they are pretty, and 

research even shows they improve mood, creativity and problem solving!</h5>
<br/><br/>

<h3>12. sweat every day</h3>
<br/>
<h5>Aim to sweat in some way each day... whether that is via running, biking, dancing, hot yoga, or any 

other physical activity you enjoy. </h5>
<br/><br/>

<h3>13. have a daily green smoothie</h3>
<br/>
<h5>Green smoothies as a snack or simple, on-the-go breakfast are an easy way to get your greens in 

each day. Check out our curated list of healthy (veggie-packed!) smoothie recipes for our favorite 

starter green smoothie recipe ideas.</h5>
<br/><br/>

<h3>14. work hard + be kind</h3>
<br/>
<h5>Enough said!</h5>
<br/><br/>

<h3>15. cultivate a positive mindset</h3>
<br/>
<h5>The only difference between a good day and a bad day is your attitude... It is true mindset is 

everything! Cultivate a positive mindset by recognizing negative thought patterns and countering them 

with positive thoughts or affirmations.</h5>
<br/><br/>

<h3>16. get enough sleep</h3>
<br/>
<h5>Most adults need 7 to 9 hours of sleep each night. But in addition to quantity, quality of sleep 

matters too! Follow our tips on getting quality sleep things like keeping your bedroom cool at night, 

avoiding blue light after dark, and more.</h5>
<br/><br/>

<h3>17. start your day with a healthy morning routine</h3>
<br/>
<h5>Start each day with fulfilling activities that set the tone for how you want to feel... whether 

that is inspired, relaxed, productive, or something else.</h5>
<br/><br/>

<h3>18. eat the rainbow</h3>
<br/>
<h5>Aim to eat all the colors of the rainbow each day. (Natural colors only, no Skittles!) </h5>
<br/><br/>

<h3>19. floss your teeth</h3>
<br/>
<h5>Floss your teeth daily for good dental health and overall health. Not only does flossing daily 

protect your teeth and gums, but good dental health is also important for immunity and heart 

health.</h5>
<br/><br/>

<h3>20. spend time alone</h3>
<br/>
<h5>Spending regular time alone helps to get to know and stay in touch with yourself (we are all 

constantly growing and changing!). Alone time is an opportunity to check in with how you are doing and 

what you want, so you can live your most intentional life. Some people enjoying hiking, going for a 

walk or run, meditating, or even sunbathing as a healthy source of alone time.</h5>
<br/><br/>

<h3>21. do things you enjoy</h3>
<br/>
<h5>This often gets overlooked as an essential element of healthy living... doing things each day that 

you enjoy! Whether that is exercise, baking, crafting, reading a book or watching TV, reserve time each 

day to spend doing activities you personally enjoy.</h5>
<br/><br/>

<h3>22. choose organic foods when possible</h3>
<br/>
<h5>here are a gazillion health, environmental and social reasons to choose organic foods, so we will 

let that more detailed post linked do the talking and just remind you to choose organic foods whenever 

possible. They better for your health, the environment, and the farmworkers growing your food.</h5>
<br/><br/>

<h3>23. a teaspoon of apple cider vinegar keeps the doctor away </h3>
<br/>
<h5>Apple cider vinegar cures everything (well... almost everything!). A teaspoon of apple cider vinegar 

in a glass of water helps aid digestion, relieve bloat, boost immunity, regulate blood sugar levels 

and more. We recommend organic, raw, unfiltered apple cider vinegar.</h5>
<br/><br/>

<h3>24. smile often</h3>
<br/>
<h5>Smiling boosts your physical and mental health (it is true!), so find ways to smile as often as 

you can throughout the day.</h5>
<br/><br/>

<h3>25. work on overcoming your fears</h3>
<br/>
<h5>Fears hold us back and keep us from living life as our best self. Acknowledge your fears and take 

steps to overcome them. (One example of this is overcoming the fear of public speaking to open new 

doors in your career and personal life.)</h5>
<br/><br/>

<h3>26. use a yoga ball as a desk chair</h3>
<br/>
<h5>Save your back/shoulders/neck and strengthen your core by using a yoga ball as a desk chair.</h5>
<br/><br/>

<h3>27. manage stress with self-care activities </h3>
<br/>
<h5>Chronic stress is detrimental to both your physical and mental health. Get to know your stress 

triggers (the things that cause stress for you, either quickly or in the long-term) as well as your 

stress releases (the things that can help calm you when you are stressed) so you can proactively cope 

with stress and maintain healthy levels.</h5>
<br/><br/>

<h3>28. intermittent fasting can promote weight loss</h3>
<br/>
<h5>We are not really into dieting (restrictions are no fun!), but intermittent fasting is more of an eating pattern than a diet. It has several notable health benefits for reducing inflammation and 

contributing to longevity, and can help speed metabolism to promote weight loss.</h5>
<br/><br/>

<h3>29. drink a glass of water after every alcoholic beverage</h3>
<br/>
<h5>Nope, we are not going to tell you to refrain from alcohol (though you certainly can if you 

want!). Drinking alcohol in moderation can be part of healthy lifestyle if done in a responsible 

manner. A glass of water after every alcoholic beverage helps to detoxify the alcohol from your body, 

as well as slow your alcohol consumption and keep you hydrated (a key factor in hangover 

prevention!).</h5>
<br/><br/>

<h3>30. practice gratitude</h3>
<br/>
<h5>Practice gratitude each day... this could be when you wake up, before bed, or during your lunch 

break at work.</h5>
<br/><br/>

<h3>31. a walk around the block is better than no walk at all</h3>
<br/>
<h5>When it comes to a healthy lifestyle, doing just a little bit is better than doing nothing at all. 

If you want to go on a walk but do not have time for your usual hour-long walk, take a short walk 

around the block. A 5-minute walk is better than no walk at all!</h5>
<br/><br/>

<h4><b>and remember: <b/></h4>
<br/>
<h3><i>+ You do not have to do everything, and you do not have to do it all at once. </i></h3>
<br/>
<h3><i>+ You are more likely to do things you actually enjoy. </i></h3>
<br/>
<h5>So, take note of which of these healthy living tips sound most enjoyable to you and start there!
